# FBLA Data Analysis Nationals 7th Place Project
By Hyun Chun, Vishwa Murugappan, and Shreyas Sundar

### Prompt: 
#### WidgetCo is a new international business selling widgets to customers in China, France, Canada, and the United States. In determining the suitability to conduct business in these countries, WidgetCo executives need an effective data analysis of the datasets that are available. You are working on WidgetCo’s data analysis team. Your team will provide recommendations to the WidgetCo executives about opportunities and challenges that they may encounter now or in the future. Using the datasets given, in addition to your own supplemental research, analyze the data and provide analyses and recommendations about the opportunities and challenges facing the business.
#
### Use the datasets found here to conduct your analysis for each country (China, France, Canada, and the United States):
• Population, total

• Poverty headcount ratio at $1.90 a day (2011 PPP) (% of population)

• Life expectancy at birth, total (years) • Population growth (annual %)

• Net migration

• Human Capital Index (HCI) (scale 0-1) • GDP (current US$)

• GDP per capita (current US$)
